# Now we tell Netfilter to mask everything coming from the /24 and going to
# ppp0. Note that we can't simply use -i eth0 as we don't know the interface
# stuff came from when in the postrouting chain. Also, we might have both
# masked and unmasked nets on eth0, so we explicitly name the one(s) we want
# NATed.
