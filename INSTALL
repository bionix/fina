Installation instructions for Fina
==================================

These instructions are very basic, they DO NOT cover configuring Fina to
do the things you want it to. They simply which of the files in the
package go where. 

WARNING! If you simply copy all the files to their locations and run
Fina, your system will be UNREACHABLE. You have been warned.

What you get
------------

The Fina installable parts are as follows:

- The Fina script itself (fina.sh). This usually goes to a place
  reachable early in the boot process, /sbin for example.
- The Fina initscript. This usually goes to /etc/init.d for "classic"
  distributions (fina.init). There is also a Gentoo-specific init script
  (fina.init.gentoo) because initscripts work differently on Gentoo.
- The default configuration file (fina.cfg). This file should be placed
  in /etc/fina. If you absolutely can't stand that location, you can put
  it elsewhere, but you'll need to edit the Fina script to load the
  config file from this new location.
- The directory with the example rules (example-rules.d/). This normally
  would reside in /etc/fina/rules.d, but the location can be configured
  in fina.cfg.

What you do
-----------

In a nutshell:
- Copy fina.sh to /sbin and make sure it's executable
- Copy fina.init (or fina.init.gentoo) to /etc/init.d, make sure it's
  executable.
- Create /etc/fina, making it readable/accessible to your tastes
- Copy fina.cfg to /etc/fina AND CHECK IT. Make sure it configures Fina
  the way you want it
- Copy example-rules.d and its contents to /etc/fina/rules.d (or
  wherever you configured the rules to be in fina.cfg).

Finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: Edit the files in /etc/fina/rules.d to
make sure Fina does what you want. Failing to do so can make your
system unreachable or open to attack. 

Also it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to run fina.sh with -p during initial
configuration. This way you can check if Fina does what you mean it to.

Example files
-------------

Fina comes with a fairly complete set of example rules files. Note that
the organization of these files is - beyond the necessities of the order
of the rules - completely arbitrary. If you'd rather keep your rules in
one file or files prefixed with prime numbers only, go ahead. If you
usually edited your single iptables-save dump by hand but now want Finas
try-to-load-go-back-on-failure functionality, simply dump your current
rules into one file in rules.d and be done.

One thing to keep in mind when organizing rules into multiple files is
that of course order matters in iptables. Sometimes it can be hard to
keep rules that are thematically related in one file without breaking
the order in which the should be executed. One way of handling this is
to split them into two files with similar names. You can even go so far
as using the lower digits of the prefixes to order the files. 

All that said, you can do whatever you please when naming the files.
Just don't use spaces, that would be a Bad Idea.
