Installation instructions for Fina
==================================

These instructions are very basic, they DO NOT cover configuring Fina to
do the things you want it to. They simply which of the files in the
package go where. 

WARNING! If you simply copy all the files to their locations and run
Fina, your system will be UNREACHABLE. You have been warned.

What you get
------------

The Fina installable parts are as follows:

- The Fina script itself (fina). This usually goes to a place
  reachable early in the boot process, /sbin is a good idea since it's
  also what the init scripts use.
- The Fina init scripts. This usually goes to /etc/init.d for "classic"
  distributions (fina.init). There is also a Gentoo-specific init script
  (fina.init.gentoo) because init scripts work differently on Gentoo.
- The default configuration file (fina.cfg). This file should be placed
  in /etc/fina. If you absolutely can't stand that location, you can put
  it elsewhere, but you'll need to edit the Fina script to load the
  config file from this new location.

What you do
-----------

In a nutshell:
- Copy fina to /sbin/ and make sure it's executable
- Copy fina.init (or fina.init.gentoo) to /etc/init.d/, make sure it's
  executable. Also add the startup links - this is specific for your
  distribution. Gentoo uses rc-update, Debian uses update-rc.d.
- Create /etc/fina, making it readable/accessible to your tastes (0700
  seems like a good idea)
- Copy fina.cfg to /etc/fina/ AND CHECK IT. Make sure it configures Fina
  the way you want it.
- Create the directory /etc/fina/rules.d/ - be sure to take care of
  proper permissions. 
- Create the file /etc/fina/minimal.rules. It should contain the bare
  necessities to make you host reachable, yet be secure. A good idea is
  to only add the IP addresse(s) of your management machine(s). That
  way, you also have a ruleset you can load in emergency situations
  (using -m)

Finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY: Edit the files in /etc/fina/rules.d/ to
make sure Fina does what you want. Failing to do so can make your
system unreachable or open to attack. The rules in example-rules.d are
just that, examples. They WON'T WORK FOR YOU. Also, you can

Also it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to run fina without -l during initial
configuration. This way you can check if Fina does what you mean it to.

Example files
-------------

Fina comes with a fairly complete set of example rules files. Note that
the organization of these files is - beyond the necessities of the order
of the rules - completely arbitrary. If you'd rather keep your rules in
one file or files prefixed with prime numbers only, go ahead. If you
usually edited your single iptables-save dump by hand but now want Finas
try-to-load-go-back-on-failure functionality, simply dump your current
rules into one file in rules.d and make a copy of a known good ruleset
in minimal.rules.

One thing to keep in mind when organizing rules into multiple files is
that of course order matters in iptables. Sometimes it can be hard to
keep rules that are thematically related in one file without breaking
the order in which they should be executed. One way of handling this is
to split them into two files with similar names. You can also use the
lower digits of the prefixes to order the files. 

Another common setup is to prefix the rule file names with the table
that they refer to. E.g. you'd have filter-000 to -999 and nat-000 to
-999 (the example rules are structured this way). The order of the
*table* loading, i.e. if filter is before nat or vice versa doesn't
matter. However, every table opener (e.g. *nat) needs to have a
corresponding COMMIT. And everything between the two is part of the same
table space. For more info, refer to the IPTables/Netfilter
documentation.
